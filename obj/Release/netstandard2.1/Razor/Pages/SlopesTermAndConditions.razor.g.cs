    The Slopes app stores and processes personal data that

    not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
    removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
    official operating system of your device. It could make your

    You should be aware that there are certain things that
    Brady Langdale will not take responsibility for. Certain
    functions of the app will require the app to have an active
    internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
    by your mobile network provider, but Brady Langdale
    cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
    functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t

    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
    be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
    the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
    other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
    responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
    charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
    (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
    you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re

    Along the same lines, Brady Langdale cannot always take
    responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to

    With respect to Brady Langdale’s responsibility for your

    bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
    updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
    to provide information to us so that we can make it available
    to you. Brady Langdale accepts no liability for any

    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
    currently available on Android – the requirements for

    will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
    and/or works with the Android version that you have
    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
